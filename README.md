## Description
This project is a simple (currently) web application that calculates carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from various modes of transport based on a specified distance. Users can enter a distance in kilometers, and the application displays the total CO2 emissions for different transport modes, including cars, buses, trains, and more. The results are presented both in tabular form and as a graph.

## Features
- User-friendly interface for entering distance.
- Calculation of CO2 emissions for various transport modes.
- Visualization of results using charts.
- Responsive design to work on different devices.

## Technologies
- **Python**: For backend logic and calculations.
- **Flask**: For building the web application.
- **Pandas**: For handling and analyzing data.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating graphs and visualizations.
- **HTML/CSS**: For frontend design.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Wartem/CO2-Transport-Calculator-Example.git

## Data
The data used in this project comes from OurWordData in the form of a CSV file from 2022. [[carbon-footprint-travel-mode.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16403775/carbon-footprint-travel-mode.csv)](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/carbon-footprint-travel-mode)

## First Version
This is the first simple version of the application. There are many opportunities for future improvements, including:
More transport modes and detailed data.
Use of external APIs to fetch updated data.
Enhanced user interface and user experience.

## PythonAnywhere Deployment
The first version of this program is currently hosted on PythonAnywhere and can be accessed at the following address: http://wartem.pythonanywhere.com. Please note that this deployment is intended for demonstration purposes and may be deactivated or moved at a later date.

## Acknowledgments
This project was developed with the assistance of Perplexity, an innovative AI tool that greatly facilitated the research and development process. Perplexity helped streamline the gathering of information and provided valuable insights into the structure and functionality of the application. By leveraging its capabilities, I was able to quickly access relevant data, explore various transport modes, and efficiently calculate CO2 emissions based on user input.
Using Perplexity allowed me to focus on the creative aspects of the project while ensuring that the technical details were accurate and well-informed. The AI's ability to summarize complex information and suggest relevant topics significantly enhanced the overall development experience. This collaboration exemplifies how AI tools can be effectively integrated into the software development process, making it easier to create functional and user-friendly applications.
